# Snake_C
implementation of snake using C following parameters of assignment given

## Information
This will be a repo created to hold a snake implementation written in C for class. All updates should be committed and have a description of what has changed, as well as documentation in the code itself.

## Guidelines (check off as progress is made)

Write a C program snake that implements the classic snake game.

-[ ] The game must utilize all available space of the current terminal window.

-[ ] There must be a visible border delineating the area where the snake can move.

-[ ] The initial length of snake is one character.

-[ ] Initial direction of the snake's movement is chosen randomly.

-[ ] The user can press one of the four arrow keys to change the direction of the snake's
movement.

-[ ] Trophies are represented by a digit randomly chosen from 1 to 9.

-[ ] There's always exactly one trophy at any given moment.

-[ ] When the snake eats the trophy, its length is increased by the corresponding number of
characters.

-[ ] A trophy expires after a random interval from 1 to 9 seconds.

-[ ] A new trophy is shown at a random location on the screen after the previous one has either
expired or is eaten by the snake.

-[ ] The snake's speed is increased in a linear proportion with its length.

-[ ] The snake dies and the game ends if:
-It runs into the border; or
-It runs into itself; or
-The user attempts to reverse the snake's direction.

-[ ] The user wins the game if the snake's length grows to the length equal to half the
perimeter of the border.

-[ ] The project executable must run from any directory (i.e., the program should run, no
matter what your directory is)
